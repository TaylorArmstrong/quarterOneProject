# Hiking In The rain

1. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
  - At first your focus will be on the location field. Please type in a city and state in/near which you would like to search for hikes.
  - The latitude and longitude of the location will autofill when you change your 'focus' off of the location field (i.e. when you click change location or switch to the search radius field)
  - If you would like to include a search radius and minimum trail length you can do this as well (distances in miles), although this is not necessary.
  - Select Change location to populate the current weather at your location, as well as a list of hikes matching your search parameters
    a) The List will include the name of the hike, a brief summary, length of the hike, difficulty, highest and lowest elevations as well as the overall ascent and descent distances. Similarly there will be some information from past hikers about current conditions and a rating based off a 5 star scale. A 'More Information' link for the hike on REI's hiking project will also be populated.

  - If you search parameters are too narrow or there are no hikes in your search area, a new field will populate to search for events in the city of your choosing.

  - Please type a city name in the search field and press 'Find an Event Near You'.
